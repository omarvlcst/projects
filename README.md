# projects (EN/ES)
A compendium of my projects, from beginner to advanced level, developed by me (with some exceptions when done in collaboration, I mention the name of the collaborator where required).

If interested in my integrator code for null geodesics in the Schwarzschild spacetime, please kindly direct to ~/posgrado/code.

Some of these projects were found, and readapted from other places. The ideas for developing others were obtained from:

<ul>
<li> Projects from  <a href="https://github.com/karan/Projects"> github.com/karan/ </a></li>
<li> Beginner projects from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180612183650if_/https://github.com/jorgegonzalez/beginner-projects"> github.com/jorgegonzalez/ </a></li>
</ul>
