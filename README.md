# projects (EN/ES)
A compendium of my projects, from beginner to advanced level, developed by me (with some exceptions when done in collaboration, I mention the name of the collaborator where required).

If interested in my integrator code for null geodesics in the Schwarzschild spacetime, please kindly direct to ~/posgrado/code.
